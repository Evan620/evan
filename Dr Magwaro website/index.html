        <p>"I consulted Dr.Vivekananda Bheemisetty regarding multiple injuries to my leg as the pain was not reducing. He was very patient with checking my reports and examining my injury, and he spent a good amount of time explaining the injury and suggesting a course of action. Not every doctor spends this amount of time on every single patient, which is great and keeps him on top when it comes to interactions with patients. I would recommend this doctor without thinking twice. Overall, it's been a great experience." <br> <strong>Harsh Vardhan</strong></p>
